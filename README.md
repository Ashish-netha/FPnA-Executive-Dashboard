## 🧩 Project Workflow
1. **Data Generation & Preparation**
   - Created synthetic datasets for Revenue, Expenses, Headcount, and Budget.
   - Ensured relational consistency using Division + Month + Year as key identifiers.

2. **SQL Data Modeling**
   - Built tables, joined datasets, and ran analytical queries to compute:
     - Total & average revenue/expense
     - Headcount efficiency
     - Budget vs. Actual variance
     - Profitability ratios

3. **Excel Validation**
   - Checked query outputs, cleaned anomalies, formatted dates and currency.

4. **Power BI Visualization**
   - Designed an **Executive Dashboard** with:
     - KPI Cards (Revenue, Profit, Budget Variance %, Expense Ratio)
     - Trend charts (Actual vs Budget, Profit Margins)
     - Division-wise Profitability and Expense Heatmaps
     - Revenue Forecasting (6-month projection)
   - Added interactive filters by Year and Division.
